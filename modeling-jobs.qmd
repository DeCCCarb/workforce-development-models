# Objective:

End goal is to have one data frame that looks something like this:

| county  | year | technology | new_capacity | total_capacity | occupation   | type    | n_jobs | ambition 
|---------|------|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------|--------|
|   SLO   | 2026 | Utility PV | 1            | 1              | construction |direct   | 5      | high
| ...     | ...  |  ...       | ...          | ...            | ...          |  ...    | ...    | low 
| Ventura | 2026 | OSW        | 1            | 1              | op and maint |indirect | 100    |

etc.

I imagine this coming together (concat) from many different dataframes: one for each county and technology

# PV model

Start with 1 piece and see if we can build this into a function from there

## Santa Barbara Utility Solar

Values from Eleanor's Tech. Scenarios sheet:

- Ambition: 722 MW by 2045
- Starting: 111 MW in 2025

First, use compounding interest to calculate yearly capacities:

```{r}
# Initial values
initial_capacity <- 111
final_capacity <- 722
years <- 20

# Calculate the annual growth rate
growth_rate <- (final_capacity / initial_capacity)^(1 / years) - 1

# Create variables to store the results
year <- 2025:2045
capacity <- numeric(length(year))
new_capacity <- numeric(length(year))

# Calculate the total capacity for each year
for (i in 1:length(year)) {
  capacity[i] <- initial_capacity * (1 + growth_rate)^(year[i] - 2025)
  if (i == 1) {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - initial_capacity
  } else {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - capacity[i-1]
  }
}

# Create a data frame with the results
sb_utility_pv <- data.frame(county = "SB", 
                             year = year, 
                             technology = "utility solar",
                             new_capacity = new_capacity,
                             total_capacity = round(capacity, 2))

# Display the table
print(sb_utility_pv)
```

Now we just need to add number of jobs! Let's just say for testing purposes that utility solar requires:
- 5 FTE construction jobs / MW
- construction project lasts 3 months
- 10 annual O&M jobs / MW
- lifetime of project is 30 years (beyond the scope of our model)  


Starting with O&M jobs:
```{r}
# O&M direct jobs ---- 
# Assign variables
om_direct <- 10

# Add columns occupation, type, and n_jobs
sb_utility_pv_om_direct <- sb_utility_pv |>
    mutate(occupation = "O&M",
           type = "direct",
           n_jobs = total_capacity * om_direct)

# O&M indirect jobs ---- 
# Assign variables
om_indirect <- 5

# Add columns occupation, type, and n_jobs
sb_utility_pv_om_indirect <- sb_utility_pv |>
    mutate(occupation = "O&M",
           type = "indirect",
           n_jobs = total_capacity * om_indirect)

# O&M induced ----
# Assign variables
om_induced <- 2

# Add columns occupation, type, and n_jobs
sb_utility_pv_om_induced <- sb_utility_pv |>
    mutate(occupation = "O&M",
           type = "induced",
           n_jobs = total_capacity * om_induced)

# Stack 3 together for total SB PV O&M jobs
sb_utility_pv_om <- rbind(sb_utility_pv_om_direct, sb_utility_pv_om_indirect, sb_utility_pv_om_induced)

print(sb_utility_pv_om)

```

Nice. Let's build this into a function, starting with a function for O&M jobs:
```{r}
# Function to calculate capacity and jobs for PV O&M
pv_om_capacity_and_jobs <- function(county, technology, initial_capacity, final_capacity, direct_jobs, indirect_jobs, induced_jobs) {
    
  # Calculate the annual growth rate
  growth_rate <- (final_capacity / initial_capacity)^(1 / years) - 1
  
  # Create variables to store the results
  year <- 2025:2045
  capacity <- numeric(length(year))
  new_capacity <- numeric(length(year))
  
  # Calculate the total capacity for each year
  for (i in 1:length(year)) {
    capacity[i] <- initial_capacity * (1 + growth_rate)^(year[i] - 2025)
    if (i == 1) {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - initial_capacity
    } else {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - capacity[i-1]
    }
  }
  
  # Create a data frame with the results
  df <- data.frame(county = county, 
                   year = year, 
                   technology = technology,
                   new_capacity = new_capacity,
                   total_capacity = round(capacity, 2))
  
  # Direct jobs
  df_direct <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "O&M", 
           type = "direct", 
           n_jobs = total_capacity * direct_jobs)
  
  # Indirect jobs
  df_indirect <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "O&M",
           type = "indirect", 
           n_jobs = total_capacity * indirect_jobs)
  
  # Induced jobs
  df_induced <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "O&M",
           type = "induced", 
           n_jobs = total_capacity * induced_jobs)
  
  # Stack them together for total jobs
  df_final <- rbind(df_direct, df_indirect, df_induced)
  
  return(df_final)
}

```


And then a function for Construction jobs
```{r}
# Function to calculate capacity and jobs for PV Construction
pv_const_capacity_and_jobs <- function(county, technology, initial_capacity, final_capacity, direct_jobs, indirect_jobs, induced_jobs) {
    
  # Calculate the annual growth rate
  growth_rate <- (final_capacity / initial_capacity)^(1 / years) - 1
  
  # Create variables to store the results
  year <- 2025:2045
  capacity <- numeric(length(year))
  new_capacity <- numeric(length(year))
  
  # Calculate the total capacity for each year
  for (i in 1:length(year)) {
    capacity[i] <- initial_capacity * (1 + growth_rate)^(year[i] - 2025)
    if (i == 1) {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - initial_capacity
    } else {
      new_capacity[i] <- capacity[i] - capacity[i-1]
    }
  }
  
  # Create a data frame with the results
  df <- data.frame(county = county, 
                   year = year, 
                   technology = technology,
                   new_capacity = new_capacity,
                   total_capacity = round(capacity, 2))
  
  # Direct jobs
  df_direct <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "Construction", 
           type = "direct", 
           n_jobs = new_capacity * direct_jobs)   # Assuming that construction jobs only last the year, #jobs/mw year will multiply by the new capacity
  
  # Indirect jobs
  df_indirect <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "Construction",
           type = "indirect", 
           n_jobs = new_capacity * indirect_jobs)
  
  # Induced jobs
  df_induced <- df %>%
    mutate(occupation = "Construction",
           type = "induced", 
           n_jobs = new_capacity * induced_jobs)
  
  # Stack them together for total jobs
  df_final <- rbind(df_direct, df_indirect, df_induced)
  
  return(df_final)
}
```

Let's use the functions for each county and occupation

NEED TO ADD IN ABMITION SCENARIOS! Make a new column with ambition = high or low.

# OSW model

## High ambition

For the tri-county central coast JEDI run, we have:

Construction:
- direct: 1452
- indirect: 4313
- induced: 1179

O&M:
- direct: 140
- indirect: 112
- induced: 136

All in FTE jobs per GIGAWATT (JEDI would not let me run for 1 MW of OSW)

Remember that construction jobs will need to be / 5, and o&m jobs are annual.


Starting with direct construction jobs:
```{r}
# Create data frame, just adding year for now ----
year = 2025:2045
cap_table <- data.frame(
    year = year
)

# Ramping up total capacity from 0.5GW in 2030 to 15GW in 2045 ----
# Initial values
initial_capacity <- 0.5
final_capacity <- 15
years <- 15

# Calculate the annual growth rate ----
growth_rate <- (final_capacity / initial_capacity)^(1 / years) - 1

# Add total capacity for each year into empty list ----
total_capacity <- numeric(length(year))

for (i in 6:length(cap_table$year)) {
  total_capacity[i] <- initial_capacity * (1 + growth_rate)^(year[i] - 2030)
}  
  
# Add total capacity into df ----
cap_table$total_capacity <- total_capacity

# Add new capacity by the year construction starts ----
cap_table <- cap_table %>%
  mutate(
    new_construction_capacity = lead(total_capacity, 4) - lead(total_capacity, 3)
  )

# Fill NAs with 0 ----
cap_table$new_construction_capacity[is.na(cap_table$new_construction_capacity)] <- 0

# Add direct construction jobs ----
osw <- cap_table
osw$occupation = "construction"
osw$type = "direct"

# Initialize jobs/per GW Year that will be multiplied by capacity each year
jobs_gw_year <- 1452/5 # Total construction jobs outputted by JEDI / 5 Years
# New jobs each year
osw$new_jobs <- jobs_gw_year * osw$new_construction_capacity

# Total jobs ---- 
osw$total_jobs <- zoo::rollapply(osw$new_jobs, width = 5, FUN = sum, align = "right", partial = TRUE)
```

```{r}
total_cap_line <- osw |>
    filter(year %in% c(2030:2045))

    filter(year %in% c(2026:2041))

osw_capacity_growth_plot_faculty_review <- ggplot() +
    geom_line(data = total_cap_line, 
              aes(x = year, y = total_capacity),
              color = "#9a8c98",
              lwd = 2) +
    geom_line(data = annual_cap_line,

```


```{r}
ggplot(osw) +
    geom_col(aes(x = year, y = total_jobs)) +
    labs(title = "Projected direct construction jobs in CCC from OSW development",

    )
```


SWEET! Now we have direct construction jobs each year from 2025 - 2045. We can reuse this code to get indirect and induced jobs. 

Now, I want to try and do O&M jobs. This will be easier, since O&M is just multiplied straight across with total capacity

```{r}
# Add direct o&m jobs ----
osw_om_direct <- cap_table
osw_om_direct$occupation = "operations and maintenance"
osw_om_direct$type = "direct"

# Initialize jobs/per GW Year that will be multiplied total capacity
om_jobs_gw_year <- 140 # 140 annual o&m jobs / GW

# New jobs
osw_om_direct$new_jobs <- NA

# Total jobs
osw_om_direct$total_jobs <- om_jobs_gw_year * osw_om_direct$total_capacity

# combine into main osw df
osw <- rbind(osw, osw_om_direct)
```

```{r}
ggplot(osw) +
    geom_col(aes(x = year, y = total_jobs, fill = occupation),
             position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Projected direct jobs in CCC from OSW development",
         y = "FTE Jobs") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
    scale_fill_manual(
                      values = c("#4a4e69", "#9a8c98")) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
```

Horray! In the future, we can go back and add indirect and induced for both occupations. Also maybe add a new row for ambition high or low and include both in one df?
